### Hallo Donya ðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer with a strong focus on backend development. I have over 3 years of experience working extensively with PHP and Javascript, particularly the Laravel framework, express js. Besides that, I have also worked on applications using node js, namely express js as the back end and vue js as the front end. However, I am currently eager to expand my skill set and knowledge by venturing into Golang (Go) programming.
